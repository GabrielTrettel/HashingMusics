Total nightmare!
Total nightmare!
You wanna hear my side?
You need to drown to know.
When all the times it hurt me to fuck you,
I built a wall with your blood to show!
God save us!
God save us all!
God hates us!
God hates us all!
Total nightmare!
Total nightmare!
Nothing to heal.
No one to break.
Pills had a role now
There's nothing to take.
Nothing to trust.
No one to fake.
You'll find out sooner
That it's best if we just know our place
(Lies!)
My infiltrated mind.
My lacerated soul.
You took me years
Create me control you.
Why let myself around with you aside?
God save us!
God save us all!
God hates us!
God hates us all!
Total nightmare!
Total nightmare!
Lie, rape, kill
Love, hate, fear
You better take your time
(Lie, rape, kill)
You better take it slow
Cause when you see the one
(Love, hate, fear)
There's nothing left to show.
Total nightmare!
Total nightmare!
Total nightmare!
Total nightmare!
