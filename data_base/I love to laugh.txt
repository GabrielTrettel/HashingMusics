alegre
I love to laugh
Loud and long and clear
I love to laugh
It's getting worse every year
The more I laugh, the more I fill with glee
And the more the glee
The more I'm a merrier me, it's embarrassing
The more I'm a merrier me
Some people laugh through their noses
Sounding something like this, dreadful
Some people laugh through their teeth goodness sake
Hissing and fizzing like snakes
Not at all attractive to my way of thinking
Some laugh too fast
Some only blast
Others, they twitter like birds
You know you're as bad as he is
Then there's the kind
What can't make up their mind
When things strike me as funny
I can't hide it inside
And squeak as the squeakelers do
I've got to let go with a ho ho ho
And a ha ha ha too
We love to laugh
Loud and long and clear
We love to laugh
So everybody can hear
The more you laugh
The more you fill with glee
And the more the glee
The more we're a merrier we
