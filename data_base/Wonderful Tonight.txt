amor
It's late in the evening
She's wondering what clothes to wear
She'll put on her make-up
And brushes her long blond hair
And then she'll ask me: Do I look alright?
And I'll say: Yes, you look wonderful tonight
We'll go to a party
And everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
That's walking around with me
And then she'll ask me: Do you feel alright?
And I'll say: Yes, I feel wonderful tonight
I feel wonderful
Because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize
How much I love you
It's time to go home now
I've got an aching head
So I'll give her the car keys
She'll help me to bed
And then I'll tell her
As I turn out the light
I say: My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh, my darling, you were wonderful tonight
