feliz
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burnin and then you're gone
Lookin' out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen
Dig in the dancing queen
