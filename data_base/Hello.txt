triste
Oh!
OOh
I love to see you walking into the room
By the shining light in up the place
And when you talk everybody stop
'Cause they know you know just what you're sayin'
The way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you roll you take everyone you love along
I love that shit
Don't fly me away
You don't need to buy a diamond key
To unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
It was many years ago (Ago)
Baby, when you stole my cool
Cuz you had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello ooh
I get so excited when you travel with me, baby
while I'm on my grind
And never will I ever let my hustle
come between me and my family time and
You keep me humble out of this hype
Cuz you know there's more to life
And if I need ya, you will be here
you will make the sacrifice
Don't fly me away
You don't need to buy a diamond key
To unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
It was many years ago (Ago)
Baby, when you stole my cool
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello ooh
Gotta feel you
And be near you
You're the air that I breathe to survive
Gotta hold you
Want to show you
That without you my sun doesn't shine
You don't have to try so... hard for me to love you
Boy without you my life just ain't the same
You don't have to try so... hard for me to love you
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
It was many years ago (Ago)
When you stole my cool
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello ooh
It was many years ago
Baby, when you stole my cool
You had me at hello
Hello
Hello oohuu
