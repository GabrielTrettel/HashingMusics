amor
A few stolen moments
Is all that we shared
You've got your family
And they need you there
Though I try to resist
Being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving
All my love for you
It's not very easy
Living all alone
My friends try and tell me
Find a man of my own
But each time I try
I just break down and cry
Cause I'd rather
Be home feeling blue
Cause I'm saving
All my love for you
You use to tell me
We'd run away together
Love gives you
The right to be free
You said be patient
Just wait a little longer
But that's just
An old fantasy
I've got to get ready
Just a few minutes more
Gonna get an old feeling
When you walk
Through that door
Cause tonight
Is the night
When I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love
The whole night through
So
I'm saving all my love
Yes
I'm saving all my loving
Yes
I'm saving
All my love for you
For you
For you
No other woman is gonna love you more
Cause tonight is the night
When I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
Yes I'm saving all my love for you
Yes I'm saving all my love for you
