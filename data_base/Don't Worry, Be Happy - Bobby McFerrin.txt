Here's a little song I wrote,
You might want to sing it note for note.
Don't worry, be happy.
In every life we have some trouble,
But when you worry you make it double.
Don't worry, be happy.
Don't worry, be happy now.
Woo-oo-hoo-hoo-oo hoo-hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Don't worry. Woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-oo-ooo
Be happy. Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Don't worry, be happy.
Woo-oo-hoo-hoo-oo hoo-hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Don't worry. Woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-oo-ooo
Be happy. Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Don't worry, be happy.
Ain't got no place to lay your head,
Somebody came and took your bed.
Don't worry, be happy.
The landlord say your rent is late,
He may have to litigate.
Don't worry, (ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha) be happy.
Look at me, I'm happy.
Woo-oo-hoo-hoo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Don't worry. Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Be happy. Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Here, I'll give you my phone number.
When you're worried, call me.
I'll make you happy.
Woo-oo-hoo-hoo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Don't worry. Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Be happy. Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style,
Ain't got no gal to make you smile,
Don't worry, be happy.
When you're worried your face will frown,
And that will bring everybody down.
Don't worry, be happy.
Don't worry, be happy now.
Woo-oo-hoo-oo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Don't worry. Wo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Be happy. Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Don't worry, be happy.
Woo-oo-hoo-oo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Don't worry. Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Be happy. Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Don't worry, be happy.
Woo-oo-hoo-oo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Don't worry, don't worry.
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Don't do it, be happy.
Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this.
Woo-oo-hoo-hoo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Don't worry. Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
It will soon pass, whatever it is.
Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Don't worry, be happy.
Woo-oo-hoo-hoo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
I'm not worried. Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
I'm happy. Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
