Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like pickin up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
I'm gonna kick my feet up, then stare at the fan
Turn the Tv on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't
(Naahh)
I'll be lounging on a couch, just chillin in my snuggie
Click to Mtv so they can teach me how to Douggie,
'Cause in my castle I'm the freakin man
Ooooh
Yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can!
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like pickin up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
(Nothing at all)
Huhul, huhuuuul
(Nothing at all)
Huhuuul, huhuuul
Tomorrow I'll wake up
Do some P90x
Meet a really nice girl
Have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out this is great
(Oh my God, this is great)
Yeeaah
I might mess around
And get my college degree,
I bet my old man will be so proud of me.
But sorry paps you'll just have to wait
