I hate a lot of things I hate a lot of people that are lame
I like to hate stuff, cause then I don't have to try and make achange
I hate teachers, I hate school,
I hate the cheerleaders and anyone who's cool (ya)
I hate the office, I hate the quad, don't wanna learn a thing
I wanna be a slob
It's cool to hate, it's cool to hate
Don't like nothin' and I like that fine
It's cool to hate, it's cool to hate
Don't like nothin' and I like that fine
Don't like nothin' and I like that fine
Yeah I hate everything, I even hate you too, so FUCK YOU!
I'm always thinkin' bad, I never have nothin' good to say
I like to tear things down than build them up,
it's easier that way
I hate the jocks and I hate the geeks,
I hate the trendies but I also hate the freaks (ya)
I hate Dr. Martens and muscle tees
I'm only happy when I'm in my misery
It's cool to hate, it's cool to hate
Liking something's just a waste of time
It's cool to hate, it's cool to hate
Liking something's just a waste of time
Liking something's just a waste of time
Yeah I hate everything, I even hate me too, so FUCK YOU!
I'll cut you down and give you lip
Being positive's so un-hip
I'll cut you down cause I'm a fool
Being positive's so un-cool
I hate the jocks, and I hate the geeks
I hate the trendies but I also hate the freaks (ya)
I hate your band, and I hate T.V
I'm only happy when I'm in my misery
It's cool to hate, it's cool to hate
Don't like nothin' and I like that fine
It's cool to hate, it's cool to hate
Don't like nothin' and I like that fine
Don't like nothin' and I like that fine
Yeah I hate everything, I even hate you too, so FUCK YOU!!
