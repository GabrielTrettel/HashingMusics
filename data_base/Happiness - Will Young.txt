Happiness is a drug
Happiness don't pull the rug on
Happiness has begun
Happiness that's never undone
Take me and blow all my cares away
And I hope that this feeling stays
'Cos I'm loving your love each day
Summer has gone and the winter's here
And I hope that the spring is near
'Cos I'm living the favourite year
Happiness is hard to get
Happiness is being wet
Happiness is a song
Happiness, it never lasts long
Happiness is the way
Happiness is being gay
Happiness is a song
Happiness never lasts long
Summer has gone and the winter's here
And I hope that the spring is near
Cause I'm living the favourite year
