If I could give you the world
On a silver platter
Would even matter
You'd still be mad at me
If I can find in all this
A dozen roses
That I would give to you
You'd still be miserable
Cause in reality
I'm gon' be who I be
And I don't feel no faults
For all the lies that you bought
You can try as you may
Bring me down but I say
That it ain't up to you
Go on and do what you do
Hate on me hater
Now or later
Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad baby
(Go head and hate)
Go head and hate on me hater
Cause I'm not afraid of
What I gotta I paid for
You can hate on me?
Ooh if I gave you peaches
Out of my own garden
And I made you a peach pie
Would you slap me out?
Wonder if I gave you diamonds
Out of my on womb
Would you feel the love in that
Or ask why not the moon
If I gave you sanity
For the whole of humanity
And ad all the solutions for the pain and pollution
No matter where I live
Despite the things I give
You'll always be this way
So go ahead and ?
Hate on me hater
Now or Later
Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad baby
(Go head and hate)
Go head and hate on me hater
Cause I'm not afraid of
What I gotta I paid for
You can hate on me?
Hate on me hater
Now or Later
Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad baby
(You cannot hate on me)
Go head and hate on me hater
Cause I'm not afraid of
What I gotta I paid for
You can hate on me?
(You cannot hate on me)
Now or later
Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad baby
(So shall it be)
Go ahead and hate on me hater
Cause I'm not afraid of
What I got a pay for
(So shall it be)
You can hate on me
Hate on me hater
Now or later
Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad baby
Go ahead and hate on me hater
Cause I'm not afraid of
What I gotta pay for
You can hate on me
